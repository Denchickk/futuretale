# futuretale-2019

Some shitty legacy FT source code from like 2018-2019 (GMS1)

Original description:

Yes, this is what you think it is.
Futuretale is now open source, and here, you will be able to (most of the time) see every change i make into the code of the game..
And yeah, the game is still cancelled, i just made this so it would be easier for people to see what i am adding (Oh right, spoiler warning) and when 2.5.0 releases and i will leave the game forever, you can take this source, and maybe, try to make your own futuretale.
Have fun.
